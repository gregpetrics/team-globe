# team-globe
Demo for visualizing a remote team on a 3D globe

A secondary is to use the console of the browser as the interface and not have to worry about UI components.

## Run
`npm start`

## Add Team Members
Edit index.html, but I'd like to add them in via the console or pass them in via paremeters when loading the globe

Can add a user via the console

## Usage
Use keyboard commands to cycle between members of the team and fly to their location
